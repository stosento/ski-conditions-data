Yesterday there was frequent snow in the air that only accumulated to an inch but it further improved the already great snow conditions. The majority of the snow surface is machine groomed and in awesome shape for carving turns. This winter has been a real gift to skiers and riders in Northern Michigan, we are now 21 straight days without a thaw. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is hominy and ham chowder or tomato for the less adventurous. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. today with an hour break at 4:30. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
