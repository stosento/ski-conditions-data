The Grooming Crew was out all night grooming many runs two times to ensure the best possible conditions today after the thaw to freeze. Please be aware that firm and icy conditions could be encountered off of the groomed surfaces. NASTAR Racing today on Birch Run from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. No NASTAR Racing tomorrow due to the Head-2-Head Race. The soup of the day is Navy Bean and Ham. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
