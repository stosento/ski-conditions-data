The forecast is predicting a few more inches of snow this afternoon. The snow total for the season has just exceeded the amount of snow we received all of last winter and it's not even February. The lifts will spin from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM today with an hour break at 5:30 PM so we can prepare for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob!",
