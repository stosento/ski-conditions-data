Groomer was setting classic tracks on Coyote while I was there, they looked very grassy, so would not recommend classic (except on Buck's) unless you like skiing in the skate lane.  Cedar trace was also rolled.  Hawk's (south golf course) was pretty great for skate, but I skipped the \"grotto of tears\" which looked too hairy for me."

We plan to do a second grooming of the green circle runs this morning to improve conditions for new skiers. A few more inches of snow are forecast to land throughout the day. There is no NASTAR racing this weekend due to the holiday. The lifts will spin from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM today with an hour break at 4:30 PM to groom for night skiing. Pete Kehoe will play the Nub's Pub today at 3:30 PM. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with a deli and espresso bar until 3:30 PM. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob!",
