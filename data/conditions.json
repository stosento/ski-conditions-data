Sunny areas were soft while shady areas were still moderately icy. Stayed out of the woods assuming trails would be an icy chopped up mess because of all the walkers. Golf course skiing should be reasonable for at least one more day."

Expect a strong East wind at the top of the hill. The wind is speed should begin to decline after noon today. The slopes were groomed last night, but a granular snow that almost feels like sand is on top of the corduroy. The soup of the day is a Butternut Squash Curry Bisque. The lifts will spin until 9:00 p.m. tonight with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Even with this very interesting weather, make it a great day at Nub's Nob",
