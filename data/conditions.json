Very little forest debris.  Much less than up north last weekend. No dirt spots even when a few turns started to soften in the sun around 12:30.  Soft turns later in the morning were not that slow. Watch out for some small ice balls that sometimes end up in the skate lanes.  Very avoidable. The hills and turn through the pines in the back is still part of the trail.  Very nice!  Used A skis. Should be great tomorrow morning after the groom.  Thank you Huron Meadows crew. Great job!  Came over from Lansing today thanks to your efforts.Check out XC Ski Headquarters up north at Higgins Lake tomorrow.  You don’t have to be on the official team to participate in the Michigan cup relays. And the trails up there have been very good the last couple mornings. Thanks for 50 years of family service and winter fun XC HQ team!"

We do expect some great skiing today as the hard snow loosens up by late morning. The sun is forecast to be out with a high temperature over 50 degrees. The lifts will spin from 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM today. Make it a great spring ski day at Nub's Nob.",
