Today starts off cold, but the temperature should climb with a high in the mid-20's. We are under a Winter Weather Advisory beginning at noon today. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 6 inches are anticipated. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is Chicken Pot Pie. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
