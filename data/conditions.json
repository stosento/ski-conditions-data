We sent a couple of cats back out to do a second groom on some of the beginner slopes. The XC trails and snowshoe trails continue to be in great shape. The Lifts will spin from 9 AM to 4:30 PM today. Pintail Peak lodge is open with a deli and an espresso bar. Bundle up and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
