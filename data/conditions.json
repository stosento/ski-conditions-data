Sunny areas were soft while shady areas were still moderately icy. Stayed out of the woods assuming trails would be an icy chopped up mess because of all the walkers. Golf course skiing should be reasonable for at least one more day."

The Grooming Crew did a fantastic job last night and the snow surface is in great shape. As the temperature goes above freezing today expect the snow to get loose in the afternoon. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is Bavarian Chowder. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
