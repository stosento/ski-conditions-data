Some of this fresh snow is laying on top of the steep groomed runs. We are doing a second groom this morning on the majority of the green circle runs along with our race hill, Birch Run. This continues to be an amazing winter for skiers and riders, we now have 90\" of snow for the season and it's not even February. The snowshoe trails and XC trails are also in very good condition. We are proud to host our friends at the 70+ ski club today for their NASTAR race. The lifts will spin from 9 AM to 9 PM today with an hour break at 4:30 PM to prepare for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
