Expect variable conditions today as a thaw yesterday has turned into a freeze this morning. The wind is up today and it's snowing hard currently. Our skilled Grooming Crew waited to groom until early this morning to create the best snow surface possible given the conditions. A variety of snow surfaces will be encountered on the slopes today. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The soup of the day is Clam Chowder. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
