    "comments": "Bring your sunglasses and get ready for an awesome day on the slopes. The snow surface is machine groomed with high quality snow thanks to sustained cold and frequent snowfall over the past few days. The temperature is forecast to nearly reach 20 degrees, which should feel like a heatwave compared to the last few days. NASTAR racing today at 12:30 p.m. on Birch Run. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is vegetable with Italian Sausage. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
