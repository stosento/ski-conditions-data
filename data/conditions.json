      "conditions": "20° and no wind at noon. Clear blue sky and fresh groom on Coyote Run and Hawk Hills. Most of trail had clean, deep packed powder track, short stretches of grass or blown in oak leaves, mostly avoidable in open areas. I used Rode super blue 1st, later Swix purple as bright sun warmed the track. Still by 4 PM, 24°, the snow remained dry and fast. Warm shop with helpful ppl, clean bathrooms, large seating area for resting, eating; I bought a year pass! 12.5miles/20.1km"

This sustained cold is creating some remarkable snow conditions. It looks like some more moderate temperatures are in store today and for the entire week with high temperatures forecast to go above 30 degrees.  The lifts will spin today from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is potato leek. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
