On the bright side, it is more work (challenging) and a good change from the rocket fast and effortless ball bearings as is typical. Wax is still insignificant…everything is fast. Still great to be skiing close to home and there seems to be a lot of daily XC traffic at HM."

Snow conditions are mid-winter excellent thanks to over an inch of fresh snow yesterday and the work of our award-winning Grooming Crew. NASTAR racing is available on Birch Run from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM. The XC trails are also back in great shape with a fresh groom following the windstorm on Thursday. Myk Rise will play the Nub's Pub from 3:30 to 6 PM. The lifts will spin from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM with an hour break at 4:30 to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
