The snow is groomed corduroy with a nice dusting of natural snow on top. The temperature will remain below 25 degrees today but the wind is light and should make for comfortable skiing. The lifts will turn from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. There is a mini park at the bottom of Dories Bowl. The soup du jour is cheddar asparagus. The cross country trails are freshly groomed. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.\n\nWe will be open daily for skiing and riding beginning on December 12.",
