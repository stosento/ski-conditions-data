Sunny areas were soft while shady areas were still moderately icy. Stayed out of the woods assuming trails would be an icy chopped up mess because of all the walkers. Golf course skiing should be reasonable for at least one more day."

There is some fog on the slopes this morning that is expected to burn off during the day and give way to some sunshine by the afternoon. The forecast is calling for a high temperature just above freezing. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The outdoor Winter Garden Cafe is also open with some food and beverages on the deck. Brian Thomas will play outside in the Winter Garden this afternoon. The soup of the day is sausage and bean florentine! The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
