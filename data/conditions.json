Not so sure about skating for tomorrow."

The fresh snow, overnight cold, and the work of our highly skilled Grooming Crew will provide an awesome snow surface. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. There is no night skiing tonight. The torchlight parade begins at 5:30 p.m. Gather at the bottom of the Green Lift to witness a spectacular  light show on skis. This is a great way to ring in the New Year with little ones that won't make it to midnight. Dane Tollas will play the Nub's Pub at 1:00 p.m. DJ CJ Bounce will be getting weird and playing family friendly beats outside in the Winter Garden starting at 3:45 p.m. The soup of the day is split pea and ham. Make it a great New Year's Eve at Nub's Nob.",
