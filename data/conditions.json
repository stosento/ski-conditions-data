Connector still there for now.Hopefully traiil in the woods makes it through the next few warm days.  Maybe we get another week or so iin woods with no connector if all goes well.Thanks for doing what you guys do to keep us going in trying weather conditios."

Sunny areas were soft while shady areas were still moderately icy. Stayed out of the woods assuming trails would be an icy chopped up mess because of all the walkers. Golf course skiing should be reasonable for at least one more day."
