The crust will fade away as the slopes are skied today. Pintail Peak will have the softest snow as it was groomed last. The wind is forecast to pick up this afternoon and the temperature should drop significantly this evening. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is clam chowder. The Völkl/ Marker/ Dalbello Speed Series returns at 7:00 p.m. with a Super G on Valley. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
