And the tracks are still there, frozen but usable .Refreezing when I was out (3-4/30pm) with still a lot of spots that are still white and not boilerplate.  Some dirt showing thru in only a few spots.  There is debris from the wind but actually not as bad as I thought.  They should be able to groom it for decent conditions this weekend.  Hopefully it won’t bring up to much dirt."
