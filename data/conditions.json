Groomer was setting classic tracks on Coyote while I was there, they looked very grassy, so would not recommend classic (except on Buck's) unless you like skiing in the skate lane.  Cedar trace was also rolled.  Hawk's (south golf course) was pretty great for skate, but I skipped the \"grotto of tears\" which looked too hairy for me."
