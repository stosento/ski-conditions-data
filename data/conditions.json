The majority of this snow was groomed, but expect an inch or two of fresh snow on top of the corduroy in some places. This type of snow is abrasive and will make your skis and snowboarders feel \"sticky\". The Tune Center can apply a hard wax in a few minutes to improve this situation. Please prepare for the cold today as the forecasted high is only a few degrees. The lifts will spin from 9 AM to 9 PM today with an hour break at 430 PM to prepare for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
