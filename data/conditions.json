The snow is machine groomed and in excellent condition. Many skiers refer to this as \"hero snow\" due to the predictable surface for easy carving. We are proud to welcome hundreds of junior ski racers to the Nordica Winter Rally today on Birch Run and JB Arena. There is no NASTAR today due to the race. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
