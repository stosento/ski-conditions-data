    "comments": "It's a cold and sunny start to the day with almost no wind. The high temperature today should be around 20 degrees. The overnight cold along with the work of our skilled Grooming Crew will make for great skiing today on the groomed surfaces. There is no NASTAR racing today due to the Head-2-Head Crockett Cup. This dual paneled slalom race with cattle gate starts is a great spectator event held on JB Arena. The racing begins at 10:00 a.m. The soup of the day is tomato basil. Lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
