      "lastUpdated": "Thu, Jan 22",
      "conditions": "Plenty of snow in woods and on golf course, woods was nicer, less wind. Trail was soft, easy climbing but not much speed on downhills. Only classic tracks were skier produced; it would be nice if the foot traffic would stop walking in the ski tracks."

Despite the cold temperatures the wind is light and it should make for a very nice day on the slopes. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and the espresso bar. The soup of the day is beef barley. Petoskey and Harbor Springs middle schools will have a ski meet on Birch Run this afternoon. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
