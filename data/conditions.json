Expect granular snow on the groomed surface this morning. Conditions should improve dramatically with new snow scheduled to arrive around lunchtime today. Nastar racing is at 12:30 today on Birch Run. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is kielbasa and cabbage. Lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. so we can groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob!",
