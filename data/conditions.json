The majority of snow fell after grooming this morning. The grooming crew is going out a second time to put lines down on the beginner terrain and less steep runs. Expect powder on the expert terrain and much of the intermediate runs. If you prefer groomers head to Pintail Peak as that will be groomed last. The soup of the day is sweet and sour sweet potato with ham. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and the espresso bar. Lifts will turn from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Grab the wide skis and enjoy an epic MLK jr. Holiday at Nub's Nob.",
