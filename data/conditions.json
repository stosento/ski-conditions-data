But still very skiable from building and back is still there.Disappointing to see the snow guns put away today.  Long term forecast shows cold for several weeks after this few day warm up.

Last night there was some light rain that turned to snow, this moisture should further improve the snow quality today. We are proud to host the historic Little Brown Jug race at 2:00 p.m. today. The Little Brown Jug is a battle of the bay between the Harbor Springs and Petoskey Middle School ski teams. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will turn from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
