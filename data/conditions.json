At 3:30 today it's snowing really hard and the trail is filling in nicely. Might be a good classic day as the track is rock solid and once it's skied in a little bit it should be good. Not so sure about skating for tomorrow."

The snow has a bit of moisture to it and should be excellent for skiing first thing this morning. Visibility may be a challenge at times today, currently there is a dense fog at the top. The wind is light and the temperature should stay near 32 degrees for the day. Pintail Peak lodge is open with food and beverage service. The soup of the day is \"it's in there\". The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
