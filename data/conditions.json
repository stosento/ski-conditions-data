      "conditions": "Plenty of snow in woods and on golf course, woods was nicer, less wind. Trail was soft, easy climbing but not much speed on downhills. Only classic tracks were skier produced; it would be nice if the foot traffic would stop walking in the ski tracks."

    "comments": "It's a cold day at Nub's Nob. The high temperature is forecast to be around 4 degrees today with a biting windchill, please dress appropriately for the conditions. Due to the forecasted windchill we will ski from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. with no night skiing. The Lodge will close at 5 p.m. tonight. Tonight's Völkl/ Marker/ Dalbello Speed Series is also cancelled. The slopes are expertly groomed today with quality snow. Expect slow snow today as the cold temperatures create more friction on ski bases. The soup of the day is clam chowder. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and espresso bar. Bundle up and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
