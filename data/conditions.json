When they are viable for skating, I prefer the grooming conditions and connectors with less traffic to Bucks Run. My heart sang when I realized Cedar Trace was groomed as it is my favorite area to skate ski at HM...and it feels like too many years since possible.  Maybe some tall grass sticking up along Coyote but no pavement, maybe some ridges to navigate but if you were light on your feet/attentive, it was all quite good.Saw the largest buck I've seen in quite some time jump across the Contractor's Loop at 543 pm (sunset) and numerous females.Thank YOU to the groomer(s) and to the Metroparks staff & leadership for making this a priority."

The majority of the snow is machine groomed today but powder can still be discovered in certain areas like the Tower Glades. Pintail Peak lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
