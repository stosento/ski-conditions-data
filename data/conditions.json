The fresh snow, overnight cold, and the work of our highly skilled Grooming Crew will provide an awesome snow surface. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. There is no night skiing tonight. The torchlight parade begins at 5:30 p.m. Gather at the bottom of the Green Lift to witness a spectacular  light show on skis. This is a great way to ring in the New Year with little ones that won't make it to midnight. Dane Tollas will play the Nub's Pub at 1:00 p.m. DJ CJ Bounce will be getting weird and playing family friendly beats outside in the Winter Garden starting at 3:45 p.m. The soup of the day is split pea and ham. Make it a great New Year's Eve at Nub's Nob.",
