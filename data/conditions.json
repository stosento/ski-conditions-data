Power has recently been restored to the lodge and our Crew is beginning the clean-up effort that includes thousands of down tree branches on our slopes and the road leading to Nub's Nob.  The lodge and locker room are open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM if you need to stop out to grab your skis. There is a small chance we could open on very limited terrain on Saturday and Sunday. We will make that decision tomorrow by noon. We hope to see you on the slopes real soon",
