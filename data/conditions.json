No new grooming but Cedar Trace was lovely for two loops - only had to dodge a small bit of animal litter and footsteps (who in the world are these residents that walk on skate decks!?  I always like to think they just need larger signage).Bucks was soft....Was hearing the 1994 Tune, \"Here Comes the Hotstepper\" --- Am wondering if spreading of snow on the golf course and Coyote Connector could keep things covered in coming days. Snow dance underway..."
