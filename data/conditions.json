      "conditions": "The classic tracks in Bucks Run were very well defined considering the sunny conditions they have been subjected to.  The skate deck was mostly icy with a small portion of mashed potato - I am concerned about what today's warming temps will do.  The connector to Buck's Run is at best very thin hardpack - no tracks."

The high temperature is forecast to climb into the 40's with a breeze from the South. The soup of the day is clam chowder. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m.\nMake it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
