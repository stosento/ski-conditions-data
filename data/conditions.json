The majority of this snow came after we groomed so you will find fresh snow on the steeps today. Pintail Peak will get a fresh groom this morning and the beginner runs will be groomed a second time this morning if you prefer corduroy. Pintail Peak lodge is open with food and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is cheesy cauliflower with ham. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Grab the wide skis and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
