They vary from rock hard nice tracks (Cedar Trace / contractor's trail) to a mix of nice track/skied -in snow-blow track (golf course trails) to deep perfect tracks (Buck's Run). Connector trails did have track: the trail to Cedar Trace had no track, and the trail directly adjacent to Buck's Run had no track. No track was set where the snow depth wasn't there. Overall, I had a good classic ski! It's was already 28 when I got to the park, but Toko Yellow kick wax worked pretty well on the mix of snow conditions."
