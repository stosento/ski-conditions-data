      "conditions": "29° and 10mph at 12:45pm. I classic skied with fresh Swix purple grip. Fast, flat, clean tracks were awesome at the start. I felt Olympian flying down the straightaways, my speed increasing as the temp climbed to 31° and the tracks acquired a subtle glaze. As the trail received more traffic, the curves lost their tracks and steep sides became shallow.  Wind increased substantially over 2.5 hrs, but Buck’s was protected, and only when I skied back to the shop, did my speed slow significantly.I had not been to HM in 3 years and yesterday explored Maltby Vista, Cedar trace and Coyote run, which were not recently groomed and frustrating due to stretches of grass in the track or tracks completely gone. With a couple inches of snow and a fresh groom, many more km should be good to go."

    "comments": "It looks like a beautiful Super Bowl Sunday at Nub's. It's a cold start that should warm up rapidly with sunshine in the forecast. The snow is machine groomed and in excellent condition. Many skiers refer to this as \"hero snow\" due to the predictable surface for easy carving. We are proud to welcome hundreds of junior ski racers to the Nordica Winter Rally today on Birch Run and JB Arena. There is no NASTAR today due to the race. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
