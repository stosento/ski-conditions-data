The groomers are out in full force this morning. As the snow begins to freeze expect variable conditions on the slopes. Today is TELEbration sponsored by our friends at The Outfitter of Harbor Springs. This is a great chance to try a pair of demo telemark skis and hang out with your free-heel friends at the warming hut at the bottom of Birch Run. NASTAR Racing today from 12:30 to 2:30 PM. Pintail Peak lodge is open with a deli and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9 AM to 4:30 PM. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
