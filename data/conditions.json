The snow surface is machine groomed and is excellent thanks to the recent snowfall. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is \"BBQ Soup\" and it's worth the trip. Petoskey and Harbor Springs Middle Schools will host a ski meet on Birch Run this afternoon. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
