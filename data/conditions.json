      "lastUpdated": "Wed, Jan 28",
      "conditions": "Almost all trails have fresh park set tracks, but exposed areas were sometimes drifted over. There are some oak leave patches in the woods where deer have been digging for acorns. Despite these issues skiing was the best I've seen at Stoney in a long time,"

    "comments": "The skiing and riding should be spectacular today. Compared to the past week today will feel like a heat wave with a high temperature forecast to reach the upper 20's with a light wind from the South. The snow is expertly machine groomed and in immaculate condition. NASTAR racing on Birch Run at 12:30 p.m. Pintail Peak is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is chicken corn chowder. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Make it a great Sunday at Nub's Nob.",
