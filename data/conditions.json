Most beginner terrain was re-groomed first thing this morning, with 3-4\" of powder on top of most intermediate and advanced terrain. The lifts will spin from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM today with an hour break beginning at 4:30 to prepare for the night session. Bahnhof Race League kicks off tonight on Birch Run. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
