A brisk 7 degrees out but no wind..we could see the snow plum.from.one of the snowmaking guns in the distance. As we put our boots on, the groomer came by setting fresh corduroy over the inch or two of new snow that fell last last night. Conditions were a little faster than I expected given the temps.We skied over to the section of Coyote Run that loops through the trees behind Buck's Run for an easy ski. I also wanted to donate speed workout (10-15 second all-out sprints). The trail was in great shape. We could hear equipment running and all of a sudden the park's material hauler came out on the trail heading back to the snow pile for more snow! We of course got way off the trail to let it by - we certainly didn't not want to slow him down! Fingers crossed - maybe Buck's Run will be open this weekend!"
