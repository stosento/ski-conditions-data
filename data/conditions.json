New snow also added on north/south section in woods along driving range on Bucks. Fast and hard pack with still some dirty snow and debris in sections. Classic tracks were deep and wide. Friday should be great if they do a nice groom in the morning. 2-3” expected Friday, let’s hope forecasters are accurate this time. Hoping park crew can roll or groom the other trails for Saturday. Thanks HM crew, your hard work is appreciated!"

The snow surface is soft corduroy this morning. All the ski runs, parks, glades, XC trails and snowshoe trails are in premium shape. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is white chicken chili. NASTAR racing on Birch Run at 12:30 p.m. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 to groom for night skiing.
