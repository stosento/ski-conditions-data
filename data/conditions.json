Very little forest debris.  Much less than up north last weekend. No dirt spots even when a few turns started to soften in the sun around 12:30.  Soft turns later in the morning were not that slow. Watch out for some small ice balls that sometimes end up in the skate lanes.  Very avoidable. The hills and turn through the pines in the back is still part of the trail.  Very nice!  Used A skis. Should be great tomorrow morning after the groom.  Thank you Huron Meadows crew. Great job!  Came over from Lansing today thanks to your efforts.Check out XC Ski Headquarters up north at Higgins Lake tomorrow.  You don’t have to be on the official team to participate in the Michigan cup relays. And the trails up there have been very good the last couple mornings. Thanks for 50 years of family service and winter fun XC HQ team!"

The new snow combined with the work of our World-Class Grooming Crew will make for awesome conditions today. The Nub's Nob Open is on Birch Run and Smokey this morning. These runs will open shortly after the race concludes. Pintail Peak Lodge is Open with a deli and espresso bar. Mike Ridley will play the Nub's Pub at 3:30 PM. The lifts will spin from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
