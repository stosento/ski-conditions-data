On these cold days with new snow the crystals are sharp and will make your skis feel slow on the snow, it's a good day to wax your equipment or drop it off at the Tune Center. The high temperature will be around 15 degrees. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Kielbasa sauerkraut is the soup of the day. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. We are proud to welcome the 70 plus ski club for their 40th annual gathering. Bundle up and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
