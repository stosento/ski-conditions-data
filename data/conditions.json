This snow dried out overnight with the cold temperature and the snow surface feels like mid-winter conditions this morning. The temperature will go above freezing later today and the snow will soften up, but it shouldn't get sticky. Pintail Peak lodge is open with a food and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9 AM to 4:30 PM. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
