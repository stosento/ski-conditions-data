      "conditions": "Skied Thursday evening.  With the slightly warmer weather, the snow was slightly soft, which was actually from the somewhat icy conditions we've had lately.  Skate deck was still very skiable.  The classic tracks had a few parts that were getting a little thin, but no bare spots yet.  Good skiing."
