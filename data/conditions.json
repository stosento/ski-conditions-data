      "conditions": "Sat 1:30-2:30 4° to 6° Full Cedar Trace and Coyote loops skating. Cedar Trace (contractors) was good and fast enough, Coyote west side plenty of snow east side sketchy but doable. Coyote loop behind Bucks had the best fast snow. 1 lap on Bucks and it was squeaky slow, classic looked fast. Fresh Toko Performance Blue ironed in and scraped and brushed well really helped."

Despite the cold temperatures the wind is light and it should make for a very nice day on the slopes. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and the espresso bar. The soup of the day is beef barley. Petoskey and Harbor Springs middle schools will have a ski meet on Birch Run this afternoon. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
