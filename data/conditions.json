The soup of the day is polish sausage sauerkraut. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. today with an hour break at 4:30 to allow for a groom before the night ski. Welcome back to winter and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
