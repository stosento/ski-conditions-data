Hawks was skate combed which dug up dirt in spots and wiped out the inside classic track. The outside classic track was still blown in from yesterday - maybe someone will ski in the outside track. In any case, the bright sun will make the dirt spots bigger. We’ll see if Hawks survives. Coyote should still be good tomorrow. Cedar Trace hasn’t been touched since the 19th."
