      "conditions": "Almost all trails have fresh park set tracks, but exposed areas were sometimes drifted over. There are some oak leave patches in the woods where deer have been digging for acorns. Despite these issues skiing was the best I've seen at Stoney in a long time,"

The snow surface is machine groomed with high quality snow thanks to sustained cold and frequent snowfall over the past few days. The temperature is forecast to nearly reach 20 degrees, which should feel like a heatwave compared to the last few days. NASTAR racing today at 12:30 p.m. on Birch Run. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is vegetable with Italian Sausage. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
