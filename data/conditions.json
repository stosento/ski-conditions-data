    "comments": "It's a cold and clear start to the day. It looks like we should see the sun this morning. Yesterday we had more surprise lake effect snow that will further improve conditions. The snow is machine groomed and in excellent condition. The soup of the day is beef barley. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
