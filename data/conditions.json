Compared to the past week today will feel like a heat wave with a high temperature forecast to reach the upper 20's with a light wind from the South. The snow is expertly machine groomed and in immaculate condition. NASTAR racing on Birch Run at 12:30 p.m. Pintail Peak is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is chicken corn chowder. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Make it a great Sunday at Nub's Nob.",
