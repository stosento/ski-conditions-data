    "comments": "It's a cold day with a high around 12 degrees predicted. Despite the temperature the wind is light and this is the kind of cold you can dress for and still have a great day on the slopes. The snow surface is in excellent shape. Expect a firm base that has great grip for carving turns. A little fresh snow landed this morning which will further improve the ski conditions. Fresh cold snow can often make skis feel slow, stop by the Tune Center for a quick wax job for those ski and board bases. NASTAR racing is open to the public today from 12:30 to 2:30 PM on Birch Run, please sign-up at the Front Desk. The Tweed Tones will be playing at 3:30 PM in the Nub's Pub. The lifts spin from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM today with an hour break beginning at 4:30 to prepare for the night session. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
