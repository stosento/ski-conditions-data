This second groom will mean a slightly delayed opening for Pintail Peak. If you venture off the groomed areas expect to find icy snow. On the groomed areas the skiing should be good. Pintail Peak Lodge will be open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. today with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
