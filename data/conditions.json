    "comments": "Today is another day where being on skis is the thing to do. Lake effect bands continued to fall on the ski area through last night, dropping another five inches of snow. Most beginner terrain was re-groomed first thing this morning, with 3-4\" of powder on top of most intermediate and advanced terrain. The lifts will spin from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM today with an hour break beginning at 4:30 to prepare for the night session. Bahnhof Race League kicks off tonight on Birch Run. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
