      "conditions": "29° and 10mph at 12:45pm. I classic skied with fresh Swix purple grip. Fast, flat, clean tracks were awesome at the start. I felt Olympian flying down the straightaways, my speed increasing as the temp climbed to 31° and the tracks acquired a subtle glaze. As the trail received more traffic, the curves lost their tracks and steep sides became shallow.  Wind increased substantially over 2.5 hrs, but Buck’s was protected, and only when I skied back to the shop, did my speed slow significantly.I had not been to HM in 3 years and yesterday explored Maltby Vista, Cedar trace and Coyote run, which were not recently groomed and frustrating due to stretches of grass in the track or tracks completely gone. With a couple inches of snow and a fresh groom, many more km should be good to go."

The crust will fade away as the slopes are skied today. Pintail Peak will have the softest snow as it was groomed last. The wind is forecast to pick up this afternoon and the temperature should drop significantly this evening. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is clam chowder. The Völkl/ Marker/ Dalbello Speed Series returns at 7:00 p.m. with a Super G on Valley. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
