      "conditions": "Sat 1:30-2:30 4° to 6° Full Cedar Trace and Coyote loops skating. Cedar Trace (contractors) was good and fast enough, Coyote west side plenty of snow east side sketchy but doable. Coyote loop behind Bucks had the best fast snow. 1 lap on Bucks and it was squeaky slow, classic looked fast. Fresh Toko Performance Blue ironed in and scraped and brushed well really helped."

      "conditions": "Plenty of snow in woods and on golf course, woods was nicer, less wind. Trail was soft, easy climbing but not much speed on downhills. Only classic tracks were skier produced; it would be nice if the foot traffic would stop walking in the ski tracks."
