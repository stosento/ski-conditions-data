Classic tracks are very hard pack or ice but still deep enough to stay on the track. The skating lane is hard pack but several people were skating without any trouble. Me? Klister. But my Rex \"Oi\" just wasn't working very well, probably because of the rushed job of waxing. Great day to doublepole!"

The snow surface is groomed and in good condition. The wind is up from the East this morning and expected to calm down as the day progresses. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with many food options and an espresso bar. Pintail terrain closes at 3:45 p.m. The soup of the day is clam chowder! NASTAR racing today from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. on Birch Run, sign up at the front desk. Rob Yates will play the Nub's Pub this afternoon. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. so we can groom for night skiing. Thanks for choosing to ski and ride with us and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
