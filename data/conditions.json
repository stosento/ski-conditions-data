The snow is in exceptional shape due to the cold, a dusting of fresh snow, and the meticulous work of the Grooming Crew. Today will be a good day to stop by the Tune Center for a fresh wax to cope with the cold and slower snow. The soup of the day is BBQ soup. Pintail Peak is open with food service and an espresso bar. Harbor Springs High School has a ski meet this afternoon on Smokey and Valley. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Bundle up and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
