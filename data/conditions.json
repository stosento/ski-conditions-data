There is also powder lines left on much of Pintail Peak. The beginner terrain and some of the intermediate runs are being groomed a second time this morning. Pintail Peak lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is cheesy cauliflower and ham or tomato soup if you prefer the more traditional. If you can make it out to ski today you should. Grab the wide boards and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
