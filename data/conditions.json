    "comments": "It is full on winter in Northern Michigan. We have been blanketed with snow on the ground and in the trees. Late yesterday 5 inches of snow accumulated at Nub's. The majority of this snow has been groomed in the base, but some of it is sitting on top of the corduroy. If you like a nice dusting of snow on top head for Pintail Peak as this area was groomed first. The lodge at Pintail is open with an espresso bar and great food options. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
