Due to the forecasted windchill we will ski from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. with no night skiing. The Lodge will close at 5 p.m. tonight. Tonight's Völkl/ Marker/ Dalbello Speed Series is also cancelled. The slopes are expertly groomed today with quality snow. Expect slow snow today as the cold temperatures create more friction on ski bases. The soup of the day is clam chowder. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and espresso bar. Bundle up and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
