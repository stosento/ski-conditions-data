The temperature will go above freezing today so softer snow is expected as the day goes on. The forecast is calling for a wintery mix of precipitation during the day. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and the espresso bar. The soup of the day is tomato. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
