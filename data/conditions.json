      "conditions": "Plenty of snow in woods and on golf course, woods was nicer, less wind. Trail was soft, easy climbing but not much speed on downhills. Only classic tracks were skier produced; it would be nice if the foot traffic would stop walking in the ski tracks."

    "comments": "Yesterday's snow is now groomed into the base and the ski surface is exceptional. Sustained cold and frequent fresh snow continues to make conditions remarkably good at Nub's Nob. The majority of the snow is machine groomed today but powder can still be discovered in certain areas like the Tower Glades. Pintail Peak lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
