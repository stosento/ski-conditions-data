      "conditions": "29° and 10mph at 12:45pm. I classic skied with fresh Swix purple grip. Fast, flat, clean tracks were awesome at the start. I felt Olympian flying down the straightaways, my speed increasing as the temp climbed to 31° and the tracks acquired a subtle glaze. As the trail received more traffic, the curves lost their tracks and steep sides became shallow.  Wind increased substantially over 2.5 hrs, but Buck’s was protected, and only when I skied back to the shop, did my speed slow significantly.I had not been to HM in 3 years and yesterday explored Maltby Vista, Cedar trace and Coyote run, which were not recently groomed and frustrating due to stretches of grass in the track or tracks completely gone. With a couple inches of snow and a fresh groom, many more km should be good to go."

    "comments": "It's a brisk and beautiful start to the ski day with some snow in the air. Despite the cold air temperature the wind is very light and it feels much warmer than the thermometer would suggest. The snow is machine groomed and continues to be in exceptional condition for skiing and riding. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is andouille and vegetable. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
