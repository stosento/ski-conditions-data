Groomer was setting classic tracks on Coyote while I was there, they looked very grassy, so would not recommend classic (except on Buck's) unless you like skiing in the skate lane.  Cedar trace was also rolled.  Hawk's (south golf course) was pretty great for skate, but I skipped the \"grotto of tears\" which looked too hairy for me."

Chairlifts will be spinning from 9 AM to 9 PM today with an hour break at 4:30 PM to groom for night skiing. Eric Jaqua will play the Nub's Pub at 3:30 PM. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with a deli and an espresso bar until 3:30 PM. Bundle up and make it a great day at Nub's Nob!",
