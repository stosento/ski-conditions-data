Classic tracks and skating lines were in good shape where protected from the wind. Kudos to the ski centre staff for doing such a great job with rentals, snack bar and general advice on a fairly busy day. Huron Meadows deserves a lot of credit for keeping cross country skiing going in the Metro Detroit area."

A skiff of light snow sits on top of the grooming on the majority of the terrain. It's a cold day with a high temperature predicted to be around 12 degrees with a breeze from the Northwest. The snow continues to be in amazing shape. Pintail Peak lodge is open today with a deli and espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9 AM to 4:30 PM today. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
