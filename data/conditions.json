Petoskey High School will host a BNC ski meet on Smokey and Valley today. These runs will only be open to the ski racers today. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is unstuffed pepper. We are excited to welcome the Whooppee Ski Club back to Nub's Nob. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. today. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
