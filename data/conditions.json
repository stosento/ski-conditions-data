    "comments": "It looks like a beautiful ski day. The snow surface is machine groomed and in immaculate condition thanks to some fresh snow over the last few days, sustained cold, and the meticulous work of our expert Grooming Crew. All terrain and XC trails are open with mid-winter conditions. The high temperature should go just above freezing today with a breeze from the Southwest. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is Clam Chowder. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
