Overall though, very skiable this morning while still cold, just don't use your fancy skis.  The snow is compacted so the footprints didn't bother *too* much.  Beautiful day and great to see so many people enjoying the snow.  Buck's run is in great shape, double tracks around most of it.Skied back via Cedar Trace (by the lake).  Do not ski down the first hill (on the left from the parking lot) as there is a large gravel patch."
