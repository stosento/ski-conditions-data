If you're looking to get out and ski, do it this afternoon; the park has already decided to close for tomorrow. Given how thin the snow coverage is it's doubtful they'll be able to reopen until they spread more snow, and based on past practices, that's unlikely to happen until after New Year . But check anyways in case we get lucky."

Rain is predicted to arrive late this afternoon and into the evening, so the best time to ski looks like the morning and into the early afternoon. The rain is predicted to transition into accumulating snow overnight. Coverage and base depth continue to be very good on all of our snowmaking runs. The Tweed Tones will play the Nub's Pub this afternoon. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food and an espresso bar. The soup of the day is meatball mushroom chowder. The lifts will spin from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. with an hour break from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
