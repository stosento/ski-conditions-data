We fully expect the Buck's Run to survive the weather. The trail has a solid ice base and the could ground is keeping it frozen. There are also piles of man-made snow ready for action. The course WILL, however, start in the woods on Buck's Run. The loop will be one mile. The longer race will be 6 laps (I can't count any higher), and the short race will be 3 laps, both days. Are we Krazy? Of course we are! But the race must go on.Chip timing.Prizes from Hammer Nutrition and Dough Mom's for everyone. Special awards for age group and overall winners. Four Toko bags and two cooler bags/backpacks for door prizes. Lunch for everyone!Be Krazy! Talk about this weekend for years to come!"
