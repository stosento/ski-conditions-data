No new grooming but Cedar Trace was lovely for two loops - only had to dodge a small bit of animal litter and footsteps (who in the world are these residents that walk on skate decks!?  I always like to think they just need larger signage).Bucks was soft....Was hearing the 1994 Tune, \"Here Comes the Hotstepper\" --- Am wondering if spreading of snow on the golf course and Coyote Connector could keep things covered in coming days. Snow dance underway..."

The snow is machine groomed and in great shape for making turns on the fresh corduroy. The soup of the day is an amazing seafood chowder. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will turn from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
