The snow is machine groomed and in great shape for making turns on the fresh corduroy. The soup of the day is an amazing seafood chowder. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will turn from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
