The snow surface is machine groomed and the snow quality is excellent thanks to the fresh snow and sustained cold. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. We are proud to welcome the 70 plus ski club for their 40th annual gathering. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
