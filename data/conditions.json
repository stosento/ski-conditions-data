New snow also added on north/south section in woods along driving range on Bucks. Fast and hard pack with still some dirty snow and debris in sections. Classic tracks were deep and wide. Friday should be great if they do a nice groom in the morning. 2-3” expected Friday, let’s hope forecasters are accurate this time. Hoping park crew can roll or groom the other trails for Saturday. Thanks HM crew, your hard work is appreciated!"

The snow is in exceptional shape due to the cold, a dusting of fresh snow, and the meticulous work of the Grooming Crew. Today will be a good day to stop by the Tune Center for a fresh wax to cope with the cold and slower snow. The soup of the day is BBQ soup. Pintail Peak is open with food service and an espresso bar. Harbor Springs High School has a ski meet this afternoon on Smokey and Valley. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Bundle up and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
