If you're looking to get out and ski, do it this afternoon; the park has already decided to close for tomorrow. Given how thin the snow coverage is it's doubtful they'll be able to reopen until they spread more snow, and based on past practices, that's unlikely to happen until after New Year . But check anyways in case we get lucky."

Over 6 inches of fresh snow landed at Nub's Nob last night and it's still coming down! The Grooming Crew is putting a second groom on many of the beginner and intermediate trails. Expect to find powder along with blowing and drifting snow. There is a strong wind from the Northwest. The Southside and Pintail Peak will have a delayed opening this morning. A few of the chairlifts may have a delayed opening this morning due to some icing overnight. Pintail Peak lodge is open with food and an espresso bar. Pete Kehoe will play the Nub's Pub this afternoon. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. to groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
