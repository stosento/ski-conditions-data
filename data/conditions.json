The temperature will rise to nearly 25 degrees with a light breeze which should make for a very comfortable day on skis. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. We are happy to host the WHOOPPEE SKI CLUB this week. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. today with an hour break at 4:30. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
