These lake effect bands are highly localized and Nub's has been getting the goods all week long. The majority of all of this snow is now groomed in and will make for excellent conditions today. The soup of the day is kielbasa and cabbage. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food service and espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Bundle up and make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
