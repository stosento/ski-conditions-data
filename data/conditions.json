The beginner runs were groomed last so they only have a small amount of new snow on top of the corduroy. The steeper runs were groomed first and this is where you will find more snow depth. All of the XC trails are being power-tilled and tracked this morning and the snowshoe trail is in good shape. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
