Groomed from there and headed towards contractors loop, it was groomed and tracks set once you got out to the loop. Soft and slow for skate, tracks had grass and dirt showing. Did 1/2 of Coyote and bailed.  Soft, slow and digging trenches. Had it been rolled on Monday today would have been great. Really bummed they are not rolling and packing down the fresh snow and then grooming. If you are strong and robust stick with Bucks unless things firm up. Cheers!"

      "conditions": "Almost all trails have fresh park set tracks, but exposed areas were sometimes drifted over. There are some oak leave patches in the woods where deer have been digging for acorns. Despite these issues skiing was the best I've seen at Stoney in a long time,"

    "comments": "Yesterday's snow is now groomed into the base and the ski surface is exceptional. Sustained cold and frequent fresh snow continues to make conditions remarkably good at Nub's Nob. The majority of the snow is machine groomed today but powder can still be discovered in certain areas like the Tower Glades. Pintail Peak lodge is open with food service and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
