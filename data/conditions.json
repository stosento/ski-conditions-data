New snow also added on north/south section in woods along driving range on Bucks. Fast and hard pack with still some dirty snow and debris in sections. Classic tracks were deep and wide. Friday should be great if they do a nice groom in the morning. 2-3” expected Friday, let’s hope forecasters are accurate this time. Hoping park crew can roll or groom the other trails for Saturday. Thanks HM crew, your hard work is appreciated!"

The majority of the snow surface is expertly machine groomed. The temperature will reach the upper 20's today and the wind is light, making for ideal conditions for a day on the slopes. The XC trails are groomed. The soup of the day is clam chowder. Pintail Peak Lodge is open with food and an espresso bar. The lifts will spin from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. with an hour break at 4:30 p.m. so we can groom for night skiing. Make it a great day at Nub's Nob.",
